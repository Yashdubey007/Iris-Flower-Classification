Iris Flower Classification. The iris flower classification project is a well-known machine learning project that involves building a predictive model to classify different types of iris flowers based on their characteristics. The project is often used as a beginner's example in machine learning because it involves a relatively small dataset and straightforward classification problem.

The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers, with measurements of the length and width of their petals and sepals, as well as the species of the flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its petal and sepal measurements.

Several machine learning algorithms can be used to solve this classification problem, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees. Once a model is trained on the dataset, it can be used to predict the species of new iris flowers based on their measurements.

The iris flower classification project is often used as a teaching tool in machine learning courses because it provides a practical example of data preprocessing, model selection, and model evaluation.
